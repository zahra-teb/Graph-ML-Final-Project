# Graph Machine Learning Final Project

<div align="justify">
  
Graph Neural Networks (GNN), which have been developed as a powerful candidate for modeling graph-structured data, are one of the hottest topics in recent years. A molecule can be naturally represented as a graph that In it, atoms (vertices) are connected by chemical bonds (edges).

In this project we attempted to use **Graph Neural Networks** for **Classification** and **Regression** on molecular data. We implemented 6 GNNs. In the last one we used edge feayures too. 

## Initial Atom, Bond, and Molecule-level Features of Datasets

Three features are extracted and utilized for each molecule: atom, bond, and molecule-level features. All features are computed rapidly in silico using the open-source package RDKit.

The initial atom and bond features are listed in tabels below. All features in these two tables are one-hot encodings except for atomic mass, a real number scaled to be on the same order of magnitude.

## Graph Classification

Graph classification is the problem of determining the category or label of a graph. If we have a dataset consisting of a large number of input graphs, the problem is to classify each of the graphs into the correct target category or label. 

We used **BBBP** dataset for classification task. BBBP (Bloodâ€“brain barrier penetration) dataset comes from a recent study on the modeling and prediction of barrier permeability. This dataset records whether a compound is permeable to the blood-brain barrier.

# Graph Regression

Regression of graphs is similar to their classification and the difference is in the loss function and the performance metric. 

We used FreeSolv dataset for regression task. FreeSolv is selected from the Free Solvation Database, which contains the hydration free energy of small
molecules in water from experiments and alchemical free energy calculations.

### Results

We chose the model_6 as the best one beacause it brought better average validation score too.
